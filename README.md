# reddit-customizable-bot
## Customizable reddit bot that allows the user to create a bot without (much) coding.

### About
Started building by following a guide available [here](http://pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/), although at this point there is almost no code from there.

You can completely change the bot's purpose very easily just by changing the config.py file. More settings will be added there as it is my priority to make this bot as customizable as possible, without the end user having to write code at all.

Right now, the example code on config.py answers the reverse of a comment when it's preceded by "!reverse".

### To Do
* Change the authentication method to OAuth2
* Add more settings to config.py
* Build an UI to completely remove the necessity of programming by the end user
